This weather dashboard is designed for people who want to look at different cities multiple times.  It initially loads with Indianapolis current conditions and five day forecast.  However, if the user has used the same browser before, their last searched city will show up.  On the left, the user can type in the box a new city to pull the conditions and forecast for.  The city will be saved in the local storage to be called back later.  

Future versions will include the following:
-Initially showing the weather data for the location of the user
-Current temp on the button for each city
-More weather data
-Better styling
-Responsive design
-icons to remove each city from the list
